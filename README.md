## Desafio proposto pela CI&T

CI&T proposed a challenge for our college class, which is to create a test automation on a given web page, it could be done in any language and any framework, it is divided into 3 parts and I would have to write the scenario in Gherkin before starting any code.

### First part
  
We have the following scenario, written in Gherkin, that we should automate:

+ Functionality: Question Bank Search. 
  
+ Scenario: Search by nonexistent question.
  
+ As I navigate to the question bank search page.
  
+ And I type 'Science: Computers' into the search field. 
  
+ When I click on the search button.
  
+ Then I get an error message with the text 'No questions found'. 
  
Now you will take this scenario and automate it on the previous site. 

### Second part
We now have the following information for a new scenario that we must test for the end user:
We need to do a category search for Science: Computers and verify that the question list has 25 items and that the paging control will appear.

### Third part
Finally, you will have to create a new scenario that was not described previously. The idea here is to really see how you would make a scenario from scratch, creating Gherkin and then automating it.

### Tools used:
+ Language: Java  
+ FrameWork: Selenium  
+ IDE: Eclipse  
+ Project Type: Maven
